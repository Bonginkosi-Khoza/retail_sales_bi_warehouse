## Business Context
A retail company operates across multiple regions and sells a diverse range of products. 
Transactional sales data, customer information, and product records are stored in separate systems, 
limiting the company’s ability to perform integrated analytics.

The business requires a centralized, analytics-optimized data warehouse to support sales performance 
monitoring, customer analysis, and trend identification over time.
